# About This Repository
Welcome to my SQL data analysis portfolio. This repository contains a collection of SQL projects where I analyze real-world business problems and datasets to extract actionable insights. Rather than theoretical exercises, these projects demonstrate practical applications of SQL in business contexts.

# Technical Skills Demonstrated
