Evaluate how users progress through each stage of the e-commerce journeyâ€”from landing to product view, product detail, cart, shipping, and billing. 
What does the data suggest about user behavior across these landers? 
In particular, identify reasons behind the sharp drop-off between the shipping and billing stages and recommend actions to optimize the funnel.
